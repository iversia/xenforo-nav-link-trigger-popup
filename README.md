Navigation Entire Link Trigger Popup
===========================

This is a XenForo 1.2 Template Modification version of Jake Bunce's [Make entire nav tab trigger popup (instead of just the down arrow)](http://xenforo.com/community/resources/make-entire-nav-tab-trigger-popup-instead-of-just-the-down-arrow.968/).

It uses regular expressions in order to find the links, so multiple template edits are no longer necessary.

Instead of having to hover over the tiny down arrow to display the sub navigation:

You are now able to simply hover over the entire link.
